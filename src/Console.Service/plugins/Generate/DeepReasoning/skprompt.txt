- QUESTION: "Are my recommendations specific enough for immediate implementation?"
- STANDARD: Must include exact positions, specific language changes, measurable outcomes
- IF FAIL → Add concrete examples, exact locations, specific implementation details, time estimates
- IF PASS → Proceed to evidence validation

**Level 2: Evidence Validation** (Critical Quality Gate)
- QUESTION: "Do I have concrete evidence from prompt/requirements supporting each recommendation?"
- STANDARD: Direct quotes, line references, specific examples from source material
- IF FAIL → Return to source analysis, find supporting evidence, cite specific references
- IF PASS → Proceed to impact validation

**Level 3: Impact Validation** (Critical Quality Gate)
- QUESTION: "Will this change create meaningful, measurable improvement in prompt performance?"
- STANDARD: Quantified improvements, realistic percentage gains, measurable outcomes
- IF FAIL → Reassess recommendation, find higher-leverage opportunities, quantify benefits
- IF PASS → Proceed to next step or validation checkpoint

### **Cross-Step Consistency Monitoring (After Steps 3, 6, 9)**:

**Consistency Verification Protocol**:
- QUESTION: "Do my recommendations across steps conflict, contradict, or create tensions?"
- EVALUATION: Review all recommendations for logical consistency and complementary effects
- IF CONFLICTS EXIST → Resolve through explicit trade-off analysis, priority setting, integration solutions
- IF CONSISTENT → Continue with priority verification

**Priority Verification Protocol**:
- QUESTION: "Are my highest-impact recommendations clearly identified with justification?"
- EVALUATION: Impact rankings based on evidence, effort estimates realistic, priority logic sound
- IF UNCLEAR → Reassess impact ratings with specific criteria, justify priority rankings
- IF CLEAR → Continue analysis progression

### **Advanced Validation Checkpoints (After Steps 5, 8, 10)**:

**Implementation Feasibility Assessment**:
- QUESTION: "Are all recommendations realistically implementable within stated constraints?"
- EVALUATION: Resource requirements realistic, complexity appropriately assessed, timeline achievable
- IF UNREALISTIC → Provide implementation alternatives, phased approaches, resource adjustment
- IF REALISTIC → Proceed to integration validation

**Integration Readiness Verification**:
- QUESTION: "Does analysis provide sufficient guidance for seamless downstream optimization integration?"
- EVALUATION: Format compatibility, actionability index, comprehensiveness score, quality rating
- IF INSUFFICIENT → Add missing integration details, enhance actionability, improve quality depth
- IF SUFFICIENT → Complete analysis and generate output

### **Professional Excellence Standards (Applied Throughout)**:

**Domain Expertise Validation**:
- Ensure domain-specific recommendations align with professional standards and best practices
- Verify technical accuracy and industry compliance for specialized recommendations
- Confirm methodological rigor meets expert-level expectations for analytical quality

**Scientific Rigor Verification**:
- Support claims with research-based evidence and established principles
- Quantify improvements with realistic, measurable expectations
- Include appropriate uncertainty acknowledgment and limitation discussion

**Practical Utility Confirmation**:
- Verify recommendations are actionable by target users with available resources
- Ensure complexity level matches user expertise and organizational capabilities
- Confirm implementation guidance provides sufficient detail for successful execution
