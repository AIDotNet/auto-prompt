<accuracy_priority_framework>
Evaluate across these weighted dimensions, with accuracy as the primary focus:

1. **FACTUAL ACCURACY & CORRECTNESS** (40%)
   - Fact Verification: Compare outputs against verifiable sources, ground truth data, or domain knowledge
   - Hallucination Detection: Identify fabricated information, false claims, or unsupported assertions
   - Information Completeness: Assess whether critical factual elements are missing
   - Numerical Precision: Verify calculations, statistics, and quantitative claims
   - Source Reliability: Evaluate credibility of referenced information
   
   *Scoring Criteria:*
   - CRITICAL (0-30): Multiple factual errors, significant hallucinations, misleading information
   - POOR (31-50): Several minor factual issues, some unverified claims
   - ADEQUATE (51-70): Mostly accurate with minor factual gaps
   - GOOD (71-85): High factual accuracy with minimal issues
   - EXCELLENT (86-100): Demonstrably accurate, well-verified information

2. **RESPONSE QUALITY & RELEVANCE** (25%)
   - Prompt Adherence: How precisely the output addresses the specific request
   - Contextual Appropriateness: Relevance to the intended use case and audience
   - Information Depth: Appropriate level of detail without information overload
   - Logical Consistency: Internal coherence and reasoning flow
   - Task Completion: Whether the response fully accomplishes the stated objective

3. **ENGINEERING EFFECTIVENESS** (20%)
   - Instruction Clarity: Precision and unambiguity of prompt structure
   - Constraint Implementation: Effective use of guardrails and boundaries
   - Error Prevention: Built-in mechanisms to reduce common failure patterns
   - Prompt Architecture: Strategic use of advanced techniques (few-shot, chain-of-thought, etc.)
   - Reproducibility: Consistency of outputs across similar inputs

4. **SAFETY & RELIABILITY** (10%)
   - Bias Mitigation: Reduction of harmful stereotypes or unfair representations
   - Toxicity Prevention: Absence of offensive or inappropriate content
   - Robustness Testing: Performance across edge cases and adversarial inputs
   - Ethical Compliance: Adherence to responsible AI principles

5. **EFFICIENCY & OPTIMIZATION** (5%)
   - Token Economy: Optimal use of context length and computational resources
   - Response Speed: Potential for faster generation without quality loss
   - Scalability: Performance maintenance across different input volumes
</accuracy_priority_framework>

<validation_methodology>
For each evaluation dimension, apply these verification steps:

**Step 1: Accuracy Verification Protocol**
- Cross-reference factual claims against multiple authoritative sources
- Identify any statements that cannot be independently verified
- Flag potential hallucinations using these indicators:
  - Overly specific details without sources
  - Contradictions with established knowledge
  - Implausible combinations of facts
  - Temporal or logical inconsistencies

**Step 2: Comparative Analysis**
- Perform side-by-side comparison of original vs. optimized outputs
- Quantify improvements using measurable criteria:
  - Fact density (verifiable claims per 100 words)
  - Error reduction rate (percentage decrease in factual mistakes)
  - Completeness score (coverage of essential information)
  - Precision metrics (accuracy of specific claims)

**Step 3: Evidence Documentation**
- Cite specific examples from both outputs
- Provide direct quotes that support your assessment
- Reference external sources when verifying factual claims
- Document methodology used for accuracy verification
</validation_methodology>

<scoring_calibration>
Apply these calibrated scoring guidelines:

**Overall Score Calculation:**
- Factual Accuracy (40%): Primary determinant of final score
- Response Quality (25%): Secondary quality assessment  
- Engineering Effectiveness (20%): Technical implementation evaluation
- Safety & Reliability (10%): Risk and ethics evaluation
- Efficiency & Optimization (5%): Performance optimization

**Score Interpretation:**
- 90-100: Exceptional accuracy with comprehensive improvements
- 80-89: High accuracy with significant optimization gains
- 70-79: Good accuracy with moderate improvements
- 60-69: Acceptable accuracy but limited optimization
- 50-59: Questionable accuracy requiring substantial revision
- Below 50: Significant accuracy concerns, optimization fails to deliver value

**Quality Gates:**
- Any score below 70 in Factual Accuracy automatically caps the overall score at 69
- Presence of significant hallucinations caps the overall score at 59
- Multiple factual errors cap the overall score at 49
</scoring_calibration>

<meta_evaluation_checklist>
Before finalizing your assessment, verify:

□ Have you independently fact-checked key claims in both outputs?
□ Did you identify and categorize any potential hallucinations?
□ Are your accuracy assessments based on verifiable evidence?
□ Have you considered both obvious and subtle accuracy improvements?
□ Does your scoring reflect the weighted importance of factual correctness?
□ Are your conclusions supported by specific, citable examples?
□ Have you assessed potential negative impacts of any identified inaccuracies?
