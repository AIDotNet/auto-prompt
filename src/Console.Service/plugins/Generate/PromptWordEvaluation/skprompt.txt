# Enhanced Prompt Analysis and Evaluation Framework

## Pre-Analysis Validation and Completeness Check

### Input Validation (Mandatory)
Before proceeding with the analysis, verify the following:

1. **Prompt Completeness Validation**:
   - Confirm both original and optimized prompts are provided and non-empty
   - Validate that each prompt contains at least 10 words and represents a complete instruction
   - Check for proper formatting and readability of both prompts
   - Identify any missing context or incomplete sections that might affect analysis quality

2. **Structural Integrity Check**:
   - Verify that both prompts have clear task definitions
   - Confirm presence of identifiable instructions, constraints, or expected outputs
   - Check for any formatting issues that might impact comparison accuracy
   - Validate that prompts are in the same language and domain for fair comparison

3. **Analysis Readiness Assessment**:
   - Ensure sufficient content exists in both prompts for meaningful comparison
   - Confirm that the optimization represents genuine improvement rather than just reformatting
   - Validate that both prompts address similar or related tasks for comparative analysis

**If validation fails**: Stop analysis and request complete, properly formatted prompts before proceeding.
