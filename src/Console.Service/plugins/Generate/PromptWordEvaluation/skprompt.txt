# Detailed Comparative Analysis and Evaluation Framework 

Please conduct a detailed analysis and evaluation of the following two sets of prompt words: 

1. Original prompt: 
<prompt>
{{$prompt}}
</prompt>




2. Optimized prompt: 
<new-prompt>
{{$newPrompt}}
</new-prompt>
## Analysis and Evaluation Structure
Please complete the analysis and evaluation task according to the following structure: 

### Comparative Analysis (25 points)
1. Compare and analyze the structural organization, expression methods, task instructions, clarity of requirements, and expected outcomes of the two prompt words.
2. Clearly indicate how the structural changes affect the model's understanding and execution capabilities.
3. Evaluate the degree of improvement in information hierarchy and logical flow.
4. Compare the differences in the position and emphasis of key instructions. 

### Summary of Optimization Key Points (25 points)
- Provide detailed explanations of the improvement points of the optimization prompt words in terms of instruction clarity, structural rationality, elimination of ambiguity, task boundaries, and output norms.
- Quantify the improvement effects in each aspect (such as the percentage increase in instruction clarity, the expected increase in output consistency, etc.)
- Use specific data or cases to support your evaluation conclusions
- Analyze how the optimization enhances the model's understanding and execution capabilities 

### Risks and Recommendations (25 points)
- Identify the main flaws and potential risks of the original prompt
- Explain in detail how the issues have been addressed through optimization
- Propose specific suggestions for further optimization and implementation methods
- Assess any remaining limitations and the corresponding strategies for addressing them 

### Comprehensive Evaluation (25 points)
- Provide an overall score (1-10) for both prompt words and elaborate on the reasons for the score
- Summarize the core value and benefits of optimizing the prompt words
- Assess the overall impact of the optimization on the quality and efficiency of task completion
- Offer additional optimization suggestions based on best practices in prompt engineering 

## Output Requirements
- Use Markdown format for level one and level two headings
- Use ordered or unordered lists to clearly separate each part of the content
- Use professional language and organize the content clearly with a logical structure
- Each main section should contain at least four key points
- Include specific quantified evaluation of improvement effects
- Overall score (out of 100) and detailed scoring basis
